# ATARI-Qlearning
This project's goal was to understand how Qlearning works, being a program which, slowly but surely, learns to play ATARI games. This project has been developed while being a Microsoft Learn Student Junior in the Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador from University Politehnica of Bucharest.
